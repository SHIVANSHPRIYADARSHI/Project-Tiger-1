<font face="ms sans serif" color="black">
<b>Project Tiger</b>, launched in 1973 by the Government of India, stands as a pioneering wildlife conservation initiative aimed at safeguarding the
endangered<i> Bengal tiger</i>.The project's primary objective is to ensure the long-term survival of this majestic species by addressing the multifaceted 
challenges it faces. At its core, Project Tiger focuses on the establishment and management of tiger reserves, designated areas where concerted 
efforts are made to protect the tiger population and their critical habitats.These tiger reserves serve as havens for the preservation and 
restoration of tiger populations by offering suitable environments for breeding, shelter, and sustenance.The project emphasizes the conservation and
enhancement of tiger habitats, striving to prevent encroachment, curb habitat degradation, and mitigate threats like deforestation and human-wildlife
conflicts. Through sustainable practices and innovative strategies, Project Tiger endeavors to strike a balance between the needs of local communities
and the imperatives of wildlife conservation.Through dedicated conservation efforts, the tiger population in India has seen a gradual increase. The
project has not only played a pivotal role in reviving tiger numbers but has also become a global model for wildlife conservation, inspiring similar
initiatives in other countries facing similar challenges.</font>
